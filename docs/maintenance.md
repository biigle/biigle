# Maintenance of a BIIGLE instance

This guide describes how basic maintenance operations such as updates of a BIIGLE instance work.

## Updating

Perform these steps to update an existing BIIGLE instance.

1. Apply the latest changes from the [`biigle/biigle`](https://github.com/biigle/biigle) repository with `git pull upstream master` (or `git pull upstream gpu` if you use the GPU setup). If this throws an error that 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository, configure the upstream repository first:

        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/biigle/biigle.git

    Check the [releases](https://github.com/biigle/biigle/releases) page for specific updating instructions. In particular, you should check if the latest changes include modifications to the `build/.env.example` file. If yes, update your `build/.env` file with the new variables. The "full changelog" on the releases page can show which files have been changed between releases.

2. Get the newest versions of the Docker images:

         $ docker pull ghcr.io/biigle/app:latest
         $ docker pull ghcr.io/biigle/web:latest
         $ docker pull ghcr.io/biigle/worker:latest


3. Run `cd build && ./build.sh`. This will fetch and install the newest versions of the BIIGLE modules, according to the version constraints configured in `build.sh`. Again, you can do this on a separate machine, too (see above). In this case the images mentioned above are not required on the production machine.

4. If the update requires a database migration, do this:

    1. Put the application in maintenance mode: `./artisan down`.

    2. Do a database backup. This might look along the lines of:

             docker exec -i $(docker compose ps -q database) \
                pg_dump -U biigle -d biigle > biigle_db.dump

5. Update the running Docker containers: `docker compose up -d`.

6. If the update requires a database migration, do this:

    1. Run the migrations `./artisan migrate`
    2. Turn off the maintenance mode: `./artisan up`

7. Run `docker image prune` to delete old Docker images that are no longer required after the update.

## Common tasks

BIIGLE runs as an ensemble of multiple Docker containers (called "services" by Docker Compose).

- `app` runs the BIIGLE PHP application that handles user interactions.
- `web` accepts HTTP requests, forwards them to the PHP application or serves static files.
- `worker` executes jobs from the asynchronous queue which are submitted by `app`. This is the only service that runs multiple Docker containers in parallel.
- `scheduler` runs recurring tasks (similar to cron jobs).
- `cache` provides the Redis cache that BIIGLE uses.
- `database` provides the PostgreSQL database that BIIGLE uses.

To interact with these services rather than individual Docker containers, you have to use Docker Compose. Here are some common tasks a maintainer of a BIIGLE instance might perform using Docker Compose.

### Inspect the logs of running containers

```bash
docker compose logs [service]
```

This shows the log file of the `[service]` service. You can use `--tail=[n]` to show only the last `[n]` lines of the log file and `-f` to follow the log file in real time.

### Restart all services

```bash
docker compose restart
```

This may be required if a service crashed or if file system mounts changed.

### Run an artisan command

```bash
./artisan [command]
```

This runs the artisan command `[command]` in the worker service.

### Access the interactive shell

```bash
./artisan tinker
```

This opens the interactive PHP shell that you can use to manipulate BIIGLE. The shell only runs in the `worker` service as a debugging mechanism.

### Change the number of worker containers

```bash
docker compose up -d --scale worker=[n]
```

Set the number of worker containers running in parallel to `[n]`. If you want this to persist, set `scale: [n]` for the worker service in `docker-compose.yaml`.
